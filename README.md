# Typescript

Hey All,

Here you can find all my Type-script code snippets. For better readability & understanding purpose, I have maintained different branches for different topics.
Followed the Net Ninja guy on YouTube for learning , tutorialspoint & the documentation for reference. 

#Better Workflow & TsConfig 

For huge projects, we've different ts files, js files, folders to maintain everything nicely. One such folder is public where the files accessible to public are placed & deployed
on the internet. 

public -> html, js, css

src -> files which we don't need to deploy on the web.

#tsconfig : The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

tsc --init : creates a tsconfig.json file.
